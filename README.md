## Requirements/Installation
- Python 3

## Program
- This program will automate to download all photos/videos given a instagram user id. 
- Running the first time will create a directory with the given instagram user id containing all posts in it.
- Running after the first time will check the directory and download **NEW** posts.

## How to run
- Simply download instastalk.py and run with instagram user id. 
- Eg. run the following line on terminal "python instastalk.py google" or "python instastalk.py han_bling_".

## Legal issue
- Note that this is solely a project I made to download all my waifu photos and as a python practice. I do not intend to go against any rules and regulations of instagram. Use at your own risk.

## Note
- han_bling_ is not my waifu.
