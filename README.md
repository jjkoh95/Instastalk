## Requirements/Installation
- Python 3 

## Program
- This program will automate to download all photos/videos given a instagram user id. 
- Running the first time will create a directory with the given instagram user id containing all posts in it.
- Running after the first time will check the directory and download **NEW** posts.

## How to run
- Simply download folder app and run python app.py
- Then enter login credentials
- The program will save your cookies in database so that you don't have to re-enter your credentials everytime
- Note that without-login-mode does not download stories of the user 

## Legal issue
- Note that this is solely a project I made to download all my waifu photos and as a python practice. I do not intend to go against any rules and regulations of instagram. Use at your own risk.
